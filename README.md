# pycopa — Python bindings for **copa**

**pycopa** is a thin, user-friendly Python wrapper around the Fortran **copa** library. It exposes copa’s ensemble MCMC samplers and convenient I/O helpers to the Python ecosystem so you can:

- call copa samplers from Python,
- read / write the binary chain outputs (NumPy-friendly `.npy` blobs),
- combine Fortran speed with NumPy / SciPy / plotting tools for analysis.

pycopa is intended for researchers and engineers who want to run copa’s high-performance samplers from Python (for example inside notebooks, pipelines, or analysis scripts).

## Installation

**Prerequisites**
- The `gfortran` Fortran compiler.
- [Fortran Package Manager (fpm)](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm) version **≥ 0.13.0** available on `PATH`.
- Python 3.6+ and `pip`.
- `make` (the provided Makefile target uses it).
- `patchelf` (used to embed rpaths into the installed wheel so users normally don't have to set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`).

**Quick install (recommended)**

Clone the repository and navigate to the `pycopa` directory:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/thomasbiekoetter/pycopa.git
cd pycopa
```
Install the package with:
```bash
make pycopa
```

To force a rebuild:
```bash
make clean && make pycopa
```

**Install in debug mode (slower)**

pycopa can be installed in debug mode which contains additional runtime checks and without compiler optimizations:
```bash
make pycopa-debug
```

## Test and example program

pycopa includes an example program to demonstate the usage and to validate that the installation has been successful. To execute the example, navigate to the `python/test` folder and run the python script:
```bash
cd python/test/single
python rosenbrock.py
```
This program samples the two-dimensional Rosenbrock function. The MCMC chains and the final walkers at completion are stored in the numpy arrays `chains` and `walkers`, respectively.
